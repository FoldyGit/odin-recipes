This is a small project I am using to showcase some basic skills I have aquired so far, these include:

<ul>
  <li> Linking to different pages within my website </li>
  <li>Linking to pages outside of my website</li>
  <li>Showcasing basic formatting of a website, like paragraphs, italic text, bold texts and so on</li>
  <li>Linking images and text descriptions for said images</li>
  </ul>
